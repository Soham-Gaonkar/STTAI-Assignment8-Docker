The repository contains a containerized microservices architecture using Docker, comprising a frontend, backend, and Elasticsearch, all deployed on a cloud platform (GCP) and managed entirely via the command-line interface.


## ðŸ”§ Key Features & Technical Highlights

- **Containerized Microservices:**  
  Each service in the three-tier architectureâ€”frontend, backend, and Elasticsearchâ€”is containerized using production-optimized Dockerfiles.  
  âž¤ *Ensures environment consistency, simplifies deployment, and enhances portability across development and production.*

- **Multi-Tier Architecture:**  
  The application follows a modular, layered structure separating the UI (frontend), business logic (backend), and search/indexing (Elasticsearch).  
  âž¤ *Improves maintainability, allows independent scaling of services, and enforces a clear separation of concerns.*

- **Docker Networking via Container Names:**  
  A custom Docker bridge network is configured, enabling containers to communicate with each other using **container names instead of IP addresses**.  
  âž¤ *Provides DNS-based name resolution, increases reliability, and avoids issues with dynamic container IPs.*

- **Persistent Data Storage:**  
  Docker volumes are mounted for the Elasticsearch container to persist indexed data across container restarts and removals.  
  âž¤ *Prevents data loss and ensures continued search functionality during updates or reboots.*

- **CLI-Driven Cloud Deployment (GCP):**  
  The entire system is deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using only the command-line interface (CLI), with no reliance on graphical tools.  
  âž¤ *Demonstrates proficiency in headless server environments, automation, and cloud-native deployment.*

- **Docker Image Optimization:**  
  Each Dockerfile is crafted using multi-stage builds, minimal base images (e.g., Alpine), and secure runtime configurations.  
  âž¤ *Reduces image size, improves container startup time, and minimizes security vulnerabilities.*
